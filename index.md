<!-- ## Biography -->

<h2 id="aboutme" style="margin: 2px 0px 0px;">About Me</h2>

I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), fortunately advised by Prof. [Jeffrey Xu Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey/) and Prof. [Hong Cheng](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-cheng-hong/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/). My research interests include LLM Reasoning, AI for Science, and Data Mining.

Recently, my research interests lie in large reasoning models and AI for science, particularly in incentivizing reasoning capabilities in LLMs with RL. I'm always excited to exchange ideas, please feel free to contact me 🤩.
